Task-3 :- Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

Description :-

Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

Dataset-Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

Implementation:-

Step 1: Importing the dataset

Step 2: Describing Dataset

Step 3: Visualizing the dataset using Matplotlib & Seaborn

Step 4: Countplot to show species of iris flower

Step 5: Correlation using Heatmap

Step 6: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):-Relation Between Species & Attributes using Barplot

Step 7: Pairwise relationship of the dataset

Step 8: Seperate Iris Flower's Attributes with Species

Step 9: Train a Decision Tree Model

Step 10: Accuracy of the Model:-

  Step 10.a:  import Sklearn's Accuracy Score

  Step 10.b: Accuracy of x_train against y_train

  Step 10.c: Accuracy of x_test against y_test

Step 11: Tree Visualization

Result:-

Accuracy of Iris Flower Classification for x_train against y_train: 98%

Accuracy of Iris Flower Classification for x_test against y_test: 100%

Thank you!!!
